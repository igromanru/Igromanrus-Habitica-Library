In an effort to protect our Steppes from turmoil, we began to secretly banish all of our stress into the icy mountains. We had no idea that it would build up over generations into the Stressbeast that you saw! When it broke loose, it trapped all of us in the mountains in its stead and went on a rampage against our beloved animals.\" Her sad gaze follows the falling snow. \"We put everyone at risk with our foolishness. Rest assured that in the future, we will come to you with our problems before our problems come to you.\"\n\nShe turns to where @Baconsaur is snuggling with some of the baby mammoths. \"We have brought your animals an offering of food to apologize for frightening them, and as a symbol of trust, we will leave some of our pets and mounts with you. We know that you will all take care good care of them.\"",
