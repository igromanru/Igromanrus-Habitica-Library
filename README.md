### How to add the Library to your project
1. Under **Libraries** press the **+'' button  
   ![add_lib](Resources/images/add_library.png)
2. Copy the Library ID, paste it into the **Script ID** field and press **Look up**
   ![paste_lib_id](Resources/images/paste_id.png)
3. Now choose the version of the Library you want to use. Easiest way is to use the **HEAD**, it's always the latest version of the Library.  
   As **Identifier** you can choose what you want, but I personally recommend to use `Habitica` as the identifier. This way you will be able to call all Library's functions with `Habitica.functioNameHere()`

4. Press the blue **Add** button and you're done, you can now use Library's functions
